# Ubiqum-Bookstore
A small 48-hour stress test project. I first completed the project in JavaScript with Vue.js and then had enough time to re-write it in Vanilla JavaScript as well.

A single-page site that takes in JSON data and outputs each object to a flippable book cover and description. A searchbox filters user input in real time by both title and book description.

FancyBox is used to display full-size image content.
